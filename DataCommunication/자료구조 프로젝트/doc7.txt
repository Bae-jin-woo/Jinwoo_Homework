Rain is a type of precipitation which forms when separate drops of water fall to the Earth's surface from clouds. Not all rain reaches the surface. Some evaporates while falling through dry air. When none of it reaches the ground, it is called virga, a phenomenon often seen in hot, dry desert regions. The scientific explanation of how rain forms and falls is called the Bergeron process.
