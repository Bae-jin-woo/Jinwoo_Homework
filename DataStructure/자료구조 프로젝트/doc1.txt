Data is a synonym for information. In computer science theory there is a clear distinction between data and information, where data is a measurement that can be disorganized and when the data becomes organized it becomes information. Data can be about reality, or fiction such as a fictional movie. Data about reality consist of propositions. A large class of practically important propositions are measurements or observations of a variable. Such propositions may comprise numbers, words, or images.
